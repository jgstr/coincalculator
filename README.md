HTML CSS Project for a Bitcoin Calculator

I was hired to write the HTML, CSS and some JQuery for this Bitcoing Calculator. 

This task required me to learn more about CSS, especially box model concepts, and HTML, namely structuring webpages for maximum readbility by both programmers and search engine crawlers.

I did NOT write the Javascript for this. But I refer to this project often to explore JS concepts and practices.
